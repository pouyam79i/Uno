plus if next player have another 7 number of fining cards increases and the fine goes to next player!<br>
Card number 8: allows the player to put another card but there is point that he must be able to put one more card, or else he is fined with one card from out cards!<br>
Card number 10: this one changes the direction of game!<br>
Card A: this one skip one player and goes to the next player!<br>
